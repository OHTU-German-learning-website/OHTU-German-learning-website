Hello!

This is a small letter from the previous team that worked on this project during the OHTU course. We had a bit of a difficult time getting started ourselves originally, so we've made an effort to ease your burden a little bit by providing some tips and advice.


Tips:

If you need to learn the technologies here and get some working hours in, you can do the courses Devops with docker or fullstack open, and mark time spent on those as working time for this course too. Two courses with one stone.

Take time to study the architecture of the project in the beginning of the course, instead of prioritising tasks right away. 

Do a lot of dailies. If you can't have everyone in the same room, do dailies via video call. If you can't arrange a video call, do dailies by text messages. Just do a lot of dailies.

Don't push code to master on the same day as you have a meeting with the customer. Do it at 18:00 the previous evening at the latest. Then you have time to debug when something innevitably breaks.


For the future:
- Consider adding a second production (staging) environment for testing before pushing to actual production.


!!! ADHERE TO THE DEFINITION OF DONE !!!
